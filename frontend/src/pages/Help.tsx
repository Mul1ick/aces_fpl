            {
                question: "How many transfers do I get?",
                answer: "Before the first gameweek, you have unlimited free transfers to build your initial squad. After the season begins, you get 1 free transfer per gameweek. Any additional transfers will cost you -4 points each."
            },
            {
                question: "Can I save my free transfer?",
                answer: "Yes. If you donâ€™t use your free transfer, it will be carried over to the next gameweek. However, you can only have a maximum of 2 free transfers at any one time."

                question: "What are the formation rules for the starting lineup?",

            },
            {
                question: "Can I make changes during a live gameweek?",
                answer: "You can make unlimited changes to your starting XI (substitutions, captain changes) right up until the gameweek deadline. Once the deadline passes, your team is locked for that gameweek. Any transfers you make after the deadline will apply to the *next* gameweek."

                question: "What chips are available and how often can I use them?",
                answer: "You have two powerful chips available: the Wildcard, which allows unlimited free transfers for a single gameweek, and the Triple Captain, which triples your captain's points. Each chip can be used once per season."
            },
            {
                question: "Can I use multiple chips at once?",
                answer: "No, only one chip can be active in a single gameweek. For example, you cannot use your Wildcard and Triple Captain at the same time."
