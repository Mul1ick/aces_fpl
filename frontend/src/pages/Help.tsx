                answer: "Before the first gameweek, you have unlimited free transfers. After the season begins, you get 1 free transfer per gameweek. If you donâ€™t use your free transfer, it will be carried over, but you can only have a maximum of 2 free transfers at any time. Any additional transfers beyond your available free ones will cost -4 points each."

            {
                question: "Can I make changes during a live gameweek?",
                answer: "You can make unlimited changes to your starting XI (substitutions, captain changes) until the gameweek deadline. Once the deadline passes, your team is locked for that gameweek. Any transfers you make after the deadline will apply to the next gameweek."
